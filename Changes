  + Added catalog_convert script to convert catalogs between formats.

v4.35

  + Changed the Astro::Catalog::IO::TST pattern match used to identify
    magnitude error columns to allow multiple characters in the filter name
    (with thanks to Paul Leyland - CPAN bug #132433).
  + Suppressed some debugging output (unless $DEBUG is set).

v4.34

  + Updated reference coordinates for 4_sesame.t test.

v4.33

    of Astro::Coords (0.19).

v4.32

  + Updated skycat.cfg file.
  + Updated RITMatch for the case of multiple filters and renamed
    the write_catalog "waveband" option to "filter".
  + Adjusted JCMT catalog formatting to match the current catalog.
  + Skipped 2_jcmt.t's test of the HOLO source in the JCMT catalog.
  + Now skip test 4_skycat_gsc.t as service has been decommissioned.
  + Updated reference coordinates for 4_sesame.t test.

v4.31

  + Fix test 4_skycat_gsc.t for users who have a SkyCat configuration
    file which does not include "gsc@eso".

v4.28

  + Mercury has been added to the list of planets to be included
    in the JCMT catalog.

v4.26

  + The search button in Tk::AstroCatalog is now operational.

v4.25

  + Tk::AstroCatalog can now be told to display additional columns
    in the widget.

v4.24

  + recommend that Astro::FITS::CFITSIO is installed rather than

    library installed.

    write_catalog.

    modules have now been updated to v2.00 to ensure that they
    are seen as new.

v4.2

  + The MPC web service seems to have changed so MPC is not functioning
    in this release.

  - Added FITSTable, ASSM, NorthStar, Binary, RITMatch, XY
    and LCOGFITSTable formats.
  - Now uses Module::Build
  - SuperCOSMOS and SIMBAD query classes have been removed since the
    remote format has changed.
